# GenAIStoryApp
The repository is to create a simple web app that takes in several user inputs and creates a unique story using Generative AI. This is built as part of a workshop to teach others how to build their first Generative AI Application. The workshop is designed to be step-by-step and can be completed with no coding experience.
